            <h3>Shelly_Render</h3>
            <p>Appearance
Shelly is a beige ammonite shell with a black aperture frequently seen on the left side of their head, although some artworks inaccurately depict it on the right side. She has orange blush and two eyelashes underneath her eyes. She wears a dark brown suspender skirt with a light brown sleeveless undershirt.</p>
