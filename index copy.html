            <p>Shelly is the Starting Brawler that is unlocked upon beginning the game. She has moderate health, a high damage output, and a fast movement speed. Her attack is a burst of shotgun shells that deal high damage up close. Her Super pierces and knocks surviving enemies back and destroys obstacles, similarly dealing high damage up close. Her first Gadget, Fast Forward, allows her to dash a few tiles to the direction she is facing. Her second Gadget, Clay Pigeons, narrows the width and increases the range of her attacks for the next 5 seconds. Her first Star Power, Shell Shock, makes her Super momentarily slow enemies down. Her second Star Power, Band-Aid, gives her a bar that charges over time and, when fully charged, heals her when her health falls below 40%. Her Hypercharge, Double Barrel, increases the spread and number of projectiles her Super fires.</p>
